Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is both regimented from day to day but constantly changes over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace.

Favored by both their community and their parents for his greater physical prowess, Roth excelled in sports and in martial training. He became a member of the local militia at a very young age, able to handle weapons too unwieldy for men twice his size. As an adult, Roth's mind turned to adventure, and it was he who brought tales of the Moontear to his brother, Gareth, and suggested they form a guild to locate the relic. When Belaphoss' madness overcame the brothers, Roth began to rage at the slightest provocation, and he belittled his more cerebral brother for allowing himself to become weak. The brothers died together, both men mortally wounding each other in martial combat.",

Perhaps they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that\u2019s why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade.\n\nHumans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human\u2019s memory. They live fully in the present\u2014making them well suited to the adventuring life\u2014but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.\n\nHumans who seek adventure are the most daring and ambitious members of a daring and ambitious race. They seek to earn glory in the eyes of their fellows by amassing power, wealth, and fame. More than other people, humans champion causes rather than territories or groups.",

Tarmikos left the Order and founded the Gilded Eye, with the purpose of striking preemptively against demonic influence, to weaken and crush evil before it is allowed to take root. Under Tarmikos' philosophy, innocents may suffer, but if that's the price paid to end the threat of the Abyss, then it is a price worth paying.\n\nThe Gilded Eye's creed is extreme, but it has recruited a number of paladins, clerics, and other devout warriors of Helm nonetheless. The order also has its share of members who joined simply for the chance to battle demons and glory in conflict, no matter the cost. Tarmikos ruthlessly weeds out those whose faith in Helm is not absolute, considering those members who do not have Helm's deepest wishes at heart to be demonic agents and traitors against the Guardian.\n\nThe Gilded Eye has small chapterhouses throughout the Sword Coast. The largest is a keep in the Neverwinter Wood, from which the order keeps watch over Luskan and the areas surrounding the City of Sails.",

Over time, the guild's original purpose was lost, and it became a fraternal order of adventurers seeking shelter, brotherhood, and honest work escorting caravans, protecting clients, finding lost heirlooms, and returning kidnapped children. All that survives now of the founders' original vision are the rituals, symbols, and code of brotherhood that hearkens back to the first days of the guild. \n\nThe Burning Dawn maintains guildhalls in Waterdeep, Luskan, and Neverwinter, as well as safehouses in Ten Towns.

They crave power and regularly abuse whatever authority they obtain, but they are also undisciplined and lazy, making them poor servants, laborers, and guards.\n\nGoblins are ruled by the strongest or smartest among them. A goblin boss might command a single lair, while a goblin king or queen rules hundreds of goblins across several lairs to ensure the tribe's survival. Goblin bosses are easily ousted, and many goblin tribes are taken over by hobgoblin warlords or bugbear chiefs.\n\nGoblins have an affinity for rats and wolves, raising them to serve as companions and mounts, respectively.
